Findings
- After going through the data we have been able to deduce that if football franchises want a successful team then they need to pay their quarterbacks 10 to 13 percent of the total salary cap. 
- Looking at the data historically, if you pay the quarterbacks less than 10 percent of the salary cap, then the franchises are more than likely to have an unsuccessful football team. 
- Based on the data analysis and anecdotally speaking, paying more than 13 percent of the salary cap to the quarterback may lead to short-term success but is not sustainable as there is not enough money to go around for the rest of the team.
- We noticed with the data that most teams that pay their quarterbacks in the 10 to 13 percent range tend to make the playoffs quite frequently
- Teams like the Jets, who for most of the past ten years don't pay their quarterback any more, haven't made the playoffs at all in the past ten years.
- Distribution of the salary has a huge impact on whether or not a franchise will be considered a winning team and the teams that distribute their salary and pay the players such as quarterbacks the appropriate money tend to sustain success. Some examples of this would be the Buccaneers when the signed Tom Brady, or the Chiefs with Patrick Mahomes.
- When we compared the playoff teams to the non-playoff teams we see that 6 times out of a 10 a team that playoff teams that pay their quarterback at least 10 percent make the playoffs and other times the teams that paid their quarterbacks 10 percent are equal to the amount of teams that pay their quarterbacks less.

What is considered a successful team?
- Success was defined as making the playoffs at least 3 times during the 10 years of this data set

What is considered a highly compensated quarterback?
- Based on our analysis, we defined highly compensate as anytime the quarterback makes 10% or more of the salary cap.
- Line charts with trending lines were developed to assess the median quarterback salary across playoff and non-playoff teams.
- For playoff teams, it was observed that all years except for 2 out of 10 the quarterbacks received 10% or more of the salary cap.
- For non-playoff teams, it was observed the all years except for 1 out of 10 the quarterbacks received less than 10% of the salary cap.
- Over the 10 year period of this data set, playoff teams are increasing the amount of salary cap percentage paid to the quarterback
- Over the 10 year period of this data set, non-playoff teams are slightly decreasing the amount of the salary cap percentage paid to the quarterback

Does paying the quarterback 10% or more result in successful teams?
- The median and average quarterback pay percentage by playoff/non-playoff teams was compared side by side to determine if playoff teams consistently have highly comnpensated quarterbacks
- A deeper of level of detail counting the number of teams and grouping by highly compensated versus non-hihgly compensated quarterbacks was developed
- These charts further supported the successful teams tend to pay 10% or more to the quarterback
- A heatmap was developed to enable visualization of teams that consistently make the playoffs layered with the percentage of the salary cap paid to the quarterback.
- The heatmap revealed that sustained success is possible with a quarterback paid less than 10% of the salary cap when the quarterback is on a rookie contract and also revealed that when the second contract exceeds the 10% threshold the team will continue to have success.
- Another insight from the heatmap verifies teams that exceed the 10% threshold continuously, had more success over the 10 year period studied.
